# LaTeXiT-metadata-MacOS
Code used by [IguanaTex](https://github.com/Jonathan-LeRoux/IguanaTex/) to extract information from displays generated with [LaTeXiT](https://www.chachatelier.fr/latexit/) on Mac and convert them into IguanaTex displays.

The end user should not need to fiddle with this code, but we make it public for reference.

# Acknowledgement
LaTeXiT-metadata was kindly prepared by Pierre Chatelier, LaTeXiT's author, to meet IguanaTex's requirements. Many thanks to him!

# Usage

`LaTeXiT-metadata-MacOS` takes as input a PDF or EMF file with encoded LaTeXiT source information, and creates a `.tex` file containing the encoded LaTeXiT source.

```
LaTeXiT-metadata-MacOS file.pdf/file.emf
```
will create a file `file.tex` with the LaTeX source.

Note that LaTeXiT itself does not create EMF files, but PowerPoint does in fact save PDF files internally as EMF files. 

When using IguanaTex to edit a LaTeX display generated by LaTeXiT and inserted into a PowerPoint presentation as PDF, IguanaTex will extract the corresponding EMF file and run `LaTeXiT-metadata-MacOS` on it to retrieve the original LaTeX source.
